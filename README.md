This repo contains all the files, code, designs, and materials to replicate this project. If I'm missing anything please let me know!

Follow [this tutorial](https://www.instructables.com/Visualize-and-Hear-Ultrasonic-Frequencies-With-a-T/) for step-by-step instruction on how to put it all together.

## Introduction

Continuing my interest in wearable augmentations that visualize phenomena, I designed a "third ear" that enables you to listen and/or visualize ultrasonic frequencies. For perspective, the normal frequency range for humans is around 20Hz to 20kHz. We start with a max hearing of 20kHz as babies and as adults our hearing declines to around 17kHz. With this third ear, you can detect frequencies between 20kHz to 100kHz, enabling brand-new sensing of your environment. You can hear the frequencies in real-time with a pair of wired headphones, or you can visualize the phenomena with a p5.js script. The device can also enable new perspective-taking, as you can hear frequencies similar to your dog (40kHz), your cat (64kHz), or a bat (100kHz).

In this GitHub repo you'll learn how to order and assemble your own ultrasonic listening device. The device works by taking those ultrasonic frequencies (20kHz - 100kHz) and transforming them into a range that we can hear (20hz - 20kHz). The device can be altered to either listen to the frequencies in real-time, record them to a computer to create visualizations, or you can design new creative ways to represent the frequencies!
